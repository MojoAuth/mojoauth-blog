Today, we're excited to launch MojoAuth — a passwordless login system to authenticate users successfully.

Imagine remembering hundreds of passwords you’ve created for different platforms and exactly which accounts they all belong to; we know it’s hard to remember all of them. Sometimes, you recycle an old password and make it less secure, or create a new one and end up forgetting it, then re-generate the password each time. 

So what’s the solution? Relying on your memory to login into your account. But how effective is that? What’s the guarantee that you will not forget them again? Now think about your customers how frustrated they can be with it.

To get over remembering numerous passwords, many users pursue unsafe shortcuts like using the same password for all applications, using weak passwords, repeating passwords, or posting passwords on sticky notes. That’s where malicious actors take advantage of this situation and steal confidential data by compromising account credentials.

Many companies think that having a password in place will solve all their cybersecurity problems, but that’s not true instead passwords can be easily compromised. In fact, [81%](https://bnd.nd.gov/81-of-company-data-breaches-due-to-poor-passwords/) of data breaches are caused by either stolen or weak passwords.

The only solution to prevent this is PASSWORDLESS AUTHENTICATION.

Passwordless authentication is a method of verifying users’ identities without the use of passwords means there is no need to generate passwords. We know this sounds weird, how login into the account is possible without a password in place. Trust us, we made it possible through MojoAuth.

MojoAuth is a passwordless authentication solution that allows users to login into their account without generating the password, which in turn provides stronger security and fewer breaches. We replaced the traditional password way of login with a more secure authentication way such as login via OTP, Magic Link and WebAuthn. This also cuts the extra step of you fumbling over your forgotten password.

## Why we built MojoAuth

We have noticed that the majority of people use the same passwords on different platforms. That means if a hacker gets access to one app of your customer, they can likely gain access to other apps as well including your company’s app.

Passwordless authentication addresses this bottleneck in securing customer data. Our beta customers’ excitement and successful experiments are testaments to the fact that MojoAuth can be a game-changer to enhance the security of businesses.

We've built MojoAuth with one goal in mind is to eliminate the need to generate a password to gain access to the accounts and reduce the security risk associated with passwords.
## Features of MojoAuth

Currently, MojoAuth supports three of the major features for passwordless authentication and they are:
### Login via Magic Link
Every time a user sends a request for access, the system sends a confirmation link (magic link) to the user’s email address which can be used only once and becomes invalid automatically after you are logged in.
### Login via OTP
OTP login has a similar process to Magic Link. One Time Password is sent to the users via Email and that can be used only once to authenticate users, as the name suggests. 
### WebAuthn
Allow users to authenticate with built-in authenticators like fingerprint, pin or using security keys like YubiKey.
### Features in pipeline
- QR Authn
- Push Authn
- Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)

## Why use MojoAuth?

**Create a great user experience:** Removing passwords allows users to sign up and login seamlessly and reduces friction caused by passwords that provide unified access to all applications and services.

**Reduce costs:** Eliminates the costs included in maintenance, security and processing of passwords.

**Say goodbye to password resets:** Without any technical expertise or help support, users can easily self enroll, manage, and recover their passwordless credentials.

**Reduce IT tickets:** It reduces IT help desk tickets related to passwords by eliminating the need to issue, secure, reset, and manage passwords.

**Stronger security:** It eliminates the risk of threats and vulnerabilities related to passwords (phishing, Keylogging, password reuse or stuffing, stolen or weak passwords, brute-force attacks, etc.). Only the right user on the right device with the proper security posture can gain access.

**Increased conversions:** Too many fields and complicated password creation standards can deter users from creating an account, onboard them by eliminating password friction.

**Customer trust:** MojoAuth provides a single, strong assurance of users' identities to achieve user trust.

**No code:** It supports no-code platforms like bubble.io and webflow so that anyone can implement MojoAuth easily even if he doesn’t know about the code.
## What makes MojoAuth the perfect tool for passwordless authentication?

**It’s simple.** MojoAuth passwordless system can be implemented without writing a single line of code—meaning you need to add a few lines of code only.

**It’s customizable.**  MojoAuth allows you to fully customize your authentication form with your brand’s logo and color scheme to give a professional appearance.
