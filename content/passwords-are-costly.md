Passwords have become an integrated part of our lives these days. With the rising Technology sector, every person has to keep an average of 25 passwords per account.

Anyone with a computer at work and internet at home is likely to drown in the management of passwords. Organizations have to ensure the security of passwords since a lot is at stake.
It just takes one lousy break for your valuable company information, addresses, emails, tax documents, sensitive workplace materials, and bank account information to fall into ill-intentioned hands.

If an attacker gets access to the password database, then all passwords are rendered useless. If the user utilizes the same password for his multiple accounts(which they usually do), one breach can compromise their security, credentials, and private resources.

## What is the problem with passwords?

The password attack methods ranging from brute force to phishing are continuously evolving and are responsible for 81% of the breaches. Most insider attacks go unreported, resulting in the average cost of insider reach as high as **$600,000 per incident**.

The risk is more for organizations that rely on third-party services, which may not inform their clients that their confidential information has been stolen. Most of these organizations are left unaware that they've effectively been breached and are now vulnerable.

A significant chunk of the support calls in the enterprise are related to password issues, or password resets. A 10,000-employee organization spends an average of **$100,000/year** simply on password management and security issues.

## What are typical attacks against passwords?

Attacks on passwords vary in cost and complexity. Some of the most popular episodes are:

- **Brute force attacks**: An encrypted blob is obtained containing credentials of interest (such as the SAM database). It can then use a computer rig to crack through the database until the passwords are revealed.

- **Credential stuffing**: A database of compromised credentials is being loaded and tested against the system hoping that one or more credentials in the database match a legitimate user.

- **Shoulder surfing**: Personal information or confidential information is stolen by peering over the target's shoulders. By its nature, it's used mainly by insider threat actors.

- **Password spraying**: A list of commonly used passwords is replayed, hoping that one of them is being used by a legitimate user. It is estimated that 16% of password attacks are performed using password spraying.

- **Phishing**: The attacker impersonates a trusted contact or creates a matter of urgency and encourages users to click on links provided that are then used to ex-filtrate passwords using an exploit kit. OR The attacker pushes the user to download a document that contains malware, which is then used to ex-filtrate the credentials. Both phishing methods are responsible for the majority of the attacks against passwords.

- **Application vulnerabilities**: Lags in the system and application patches are targeted and exploited to inject malware to ex-filtrate the credentials.

- **Bribe**: The attacker bribes an insider to either obtain credentials on their behalf or perform malicious actions that allow the attacker to bypass corporate security.

- **Extortion**: The attacker has, or pretends to have the possession of materials of compromising nature, such as explicit photos, or videos and uses that as leverage to obtain access to further information and/or obtain valid credentials.

- **Negligence**: System misconfiguration or unprotected storage and credentials uploaded to code repositories are just some examples of negligence.

## What is the Solution?

The best way to avoid password leaks is to prevent passwords altogether. Passwordless authentication removes the need to memorise multiple secrets by verifying the user based on a “possession factor”, which could be an object that uniquely identifies the user (e.g. a one-time password generator, a registered mobile device, a registered email, or a hardware token) or an “inherent factor” like a person’s biometric signature (e.g. fingerprint, face, retina, etc.).

By using the verifying options such as magic link, email OTP, webAuthn, and phone login, one can prevent the password attacks, and thus reducing the cost of passwords considerably.

One of such products is MojoAuth passwordless login feature. It provides a seamless and convenient passwordless authentication which is easy to use, reliable, stable, and secure.
